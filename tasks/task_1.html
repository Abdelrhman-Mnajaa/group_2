        Write a function named tellFortune that:
        takes 4 arguments: number of children,
        partner's name, geographic location, job title.
        outputs your fortune to the screen like so:
        "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

        Ex: tellFortune('software engineer', 'Jordan', 'Alice', 3);
        => "You will be a software engineer in Jordan, and married to Alice with 3 kids."
